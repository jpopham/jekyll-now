The more posts I write in this blog the more I see the need for filtering.  Now I think I see better the difference between categories and tags.

### Tags
Filtering by tag isn't really necessary, there are already a lot of them and the number will grow almost without limit over time.  Clicking on a tag at the bottom of a post is a sufficient way to see all posts that contain that tag.

### Categories
On the other hand, categories are thematic, there are good reason why a visitor would only want to see posts limited to *Blogging* or *Software*.  In addition the number of categories is likely to remain fairly small.  The way a lot of blogs introduce category filtering is to have a list of categories in the left or right margin of the blog.  I prefer to put my category selection at the top due to the amount of space taken up by marginal stuff.
