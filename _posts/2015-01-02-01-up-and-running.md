Although I registered with GitHub nearly two years ago, it was only today that I started using it.  I've been rummaging around with both blogging and programming for many years without any great sense of direction; but the conjunction of three things has led to this blog.  

The  first thing was the need to write my first proper OSX app (of which more, perhaps, in a later post), happened to come shortly after Apple introduced the Swift programming language in the Summer of 2014.  As a consequence Swift was a natural choice for writing the app.

The second thing was accidentally coming across GitHub Pages and Jekyll - a simple way of publishing static web pages, particularly blogs. 

The third thing was receiving a Christmas gift of a [blink(1)](blink1.thingM.com) - a programable twin LED mounted on a USB connector.  This comes with much [open source software and classes for various programming languages]( https://github.com/todbot/blink1), but doesn't yet have anything in Swift.  Now I know that Swift is specifically designed to link easily with Objective-C modules (and therefore with the C modules provided), but the devil in me wants to write as much as possible in Swift.

Putting all these things together meant "I'm going to try and write a Swift class/module/library (I'm always a bit sketchy about terminology) to control my blink(1) and I'm going to blog on my progress in GitHub Pages using Jekyll".

I had one or two false starts, but I then found [this wonderful post](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) from Barry Clark, which I followed absolutely - this is the result.
