I have always been one to flit from subject to subject - both inside and outside a work environment, life is generally like that. Given that a blog (with a little cheating here and there) is generally written chronologically, I feel the need to be able to identify themes and topics so that all the stuff on a single subject can be gathered together for a comprehensive read (if only by me).

### Categories and tags
Whilst I have often come across Categories and Tags in previous blogging, I have not been entirely clear what they are.  A quick trip to Google found this on [WordPress](http://en.support.wordpress.com/posts/categories-vs-tags/)

Although that is not a rigourous definition, it is good enough for me and one thta I will bear in mind.

### Adding categories and tags to Jekyll
The Jekyll starting point that I chose does not have categories or tags so a bit of research was needed.  The relevant documentation seemed to me to vary between non-existant and opaque, so I opted to look at some [Jekyll blogs on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/sites).   Two things suprised me:
- how many blogs there were
- how few of them used categories or tags

I eventually found a few sites that used them and this led me to four points of investigation
- how do you specify categories and tags in a post?
- how (if at all) do you display the categories and tags attached to a post?
- how do you display category and tag based lists of posts?
- how do you direct visitors to the category and tag based lists of posts?

### Specifying tags and categories in a post
This is the easy one.  Put an entry in the [Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) like this:
    
    categories:
    - Blogging
    - Projects

or like this:

    tags:
    - Jekyll
    - categories
    - tags
    - frontmatter
