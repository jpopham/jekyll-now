title: Tuning the blog - 5) a better masthead

Nearly there with the basic functionality of the blog.  Time to put a bit more style into it.
First up - a better masthead.  Given the subject matter of the blog, I wanted it to have something of the look of [Apple's Swift page](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).  

The orange bit was fairly easy with some tweaks to `styles.scss`. However I couldn't find a font that rendered on the web with the elegance of the one used by Apple.  It turns out that neither could Apple.  The main text ("Swift") is actually a graphic.  So that's precisely what I did to produce the main text.  

I'm now on the look out for a public domain picture of a tortoise.
