In my last post I mentioned that I preferred my list of categories to go along the top of the summary of posts rather than in a column to the left or right.  I also wanted them to appear in the same colours that were used in the blog posts.  This is the code that I used:

<div></div>


I put this in `_layouts\cathead.html` and included it in `_layouts\blog_by_html`
