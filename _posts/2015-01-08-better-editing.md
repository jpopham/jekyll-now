I mentioned in my previous post that I'm now using [Working Copy](https://appsto.re/gb/xONC1.i) for posting to this blog and updating posts.  What I didn't say is that I'm not using it to *edit* the posts prior to them being uploaded.  

Although Working Copy has an adequate editor, I wasn't entirely happy with it.  It seemed a little sluggish at times and the preview rendering of the markdown wasn't always correct especially in respect of the front matter. Luckily *Working Copy* can act as a file provider to apps that implement the iOS 8 document picker extension.  There aren't many of these yet, and very few that will edit and display Markdown well.

I've found two, both priced at Â£6.99, both able to sync across iPads and iPhones, and both very full featured.  They are however very different in their approach.  The first (and the one I'm using to produce this post is [Draft 4](https://appsto.re/gb/BTL91.i), this has a very appealing minimalist user interface, but is nonetheless highly configurable, even to the extent of being able to change how Markdown is previewed.

The second is [Textastic](https://appsto.re/gb/KWo3w.i), which is a much more traditional programmer's editor.  At the moment I prefer *Draft*.
